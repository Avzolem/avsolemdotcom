## A New Frontier for Art and Technology 🌐

I'm thrilled to share my involvement in **HYBR1DA**, an ambitious project that positions Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua (UACH) at the forefront of metaverse innovation in education and culture.

## What is HYBR1DA?

HYBR1DA is more than just a virtual space—it's a **laboratory of convergences and hybridizations** where art, design, and technology merge to create unprecedented forms of expression.

As our team describes it:
