## üéπ Bringing Life to Generic Hardware

Created a **custom driver and configuration UI** for a Chinese mini keyboard that lacked proper software support, making it fully functional and customizable.

## The Challenge

The SayoDevice 02C is a popular budget mini keyboard from China that ships with:
- No English documentation
- Buggy proprietary software
- Limited customization options
- Compatibility issues

## My Solution

I reverse-engineered the device protocol and created:
- Custom driver for Windows/Linux
- User-friendly configuration UI
- Macro programming support
- RGB lighting control

## Features Implemented

- ‚å®Ô∏è **Key Remapping**
  - Any key to any function
  - Multi-key combinations
  - Layer support
  - Media controls

- üé® **RGB Control**
  - Custom lighting effects
  - Per-key RGB
  - Animation speeds
  - Brightness control

- üéØ **Macro System**
  - Record macros
  - Timing control
  - Complex sequences
  - Game profiles

- üíæ **Profile Management**
  - Save/load profiles
  - Import/export
  - Cloud sync
  - Auto-switching

## Technical Implementation

- **Languages**: C++, Python
- **UI Framework**: Qt/PyQt
- **Protocol**: USB HID
- **Reverse Engineering**: Wireshark, USB analysis
- **Platform**: Windows, Linux

## Development Process

1. **Protocol Analysis**
   - Captured USB packets
   - Decoded communication protocol
   - Identified command structure

2. **Driver Development**
   - Implemented USB HID communication
   - Created command library
   - Built abstraction layer

3. **UI Design**
   - User-friendly interface
   - Real-time preview
   - Drag-and-drop configuration

## Impact & Reception

- **1000+ downloads** on GitHub
- Featured in mechanical keyboard communities
- Requests for support of other devices
- Inspired similar projects

## Key Achievements

- Made unusable hardware fully functional
- Saved users from buying expensive alternatives
- Created better software than original manufacturer
- Open-sourced for community benefit

## Supported Features

- Windows 10/11
- Linux (Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora)
- Full RGB spectrum
- 50+ macro slots
- Unlimited profiles
- No internet required

## Community Contributions

The project is open source and accepts contributions:
- Bug fixes
- New features
- Device support
- Translations
