## Project Overview

A browser-based implementation of the classic Diablo 1 game, powered by WebAssembly technology. This project brings the legendary 1996 action RPG to modern web browsers without requiring any installation or plugins.

## Technology Behind It

- **DevilutionX**: A reconstructed source port of the original Diablo game, created through meticulous reverse engineering
- **DiabloWeb**: WebAssembly port by d07RiV that compiles the C++ codebase to run natively in browsers
- **Emscripten**: Toolchain used to compile the game engine to WebAssembly

## Features

- **Zero Installation**
  - Play directly in your browser
  - No downloads or plugins required
  - Works on desktop and mobile browsers

- **Full Game Support**
  - Shareware version available for free
  - Full version playable with your own DIABDAT.MPQ
  - All original quests and dungeons

- **Save System**
  - Automatic save to browser storage
  - Resume your adventure anytime
  - Multiple character slots

- **Fullscreen Mode**
  - Immersive gaming experience
  - Keyboard and mouse controls
  - Audio support

## How It Works

The original Diablo game was reverse engineered by the Devilution project to recreate clean C++ source code. DiabloWeb then compiles this using Emscripten to WebAssembly (WASM), allowing the game to run at near-native speeds in modern browsers.
